## **Login Methods in Windows**

There are **four ways** to authenticate in Windows:

1. **Username & Password**  
The most common method, but vulnerable to attacks if not secured properly.
2. **Smart Card (Certificate)**  
Requires a physical smart card and a certificate to authenticate.
3. **Biometric Device**  
Uses fingerprint, facial recognition, or retina scan for authentication.
4. **Windows Hello for Business**  
A modern authentication method combining biometrics and PIN with enhanced security.
