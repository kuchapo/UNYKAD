# Data Types in Rust

## Primitive Types

### Integers

There are Signed and Unsigned Integer Types. Signed Integers can be positive or negative whole numbers while Unsigned Integers can only be positive.

| Lenght  | Signed | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

### Floating-point numbers
### Boolean
### Character

## Compund Types

These types group multiple values into a single unit. We differ Tuples and Arrays.
